Git is a version control system while GitHub is a web based hosting service for git repositories. 

** version control: It is a system which records changes to your file or files over time, 
so as to recall a specific version of your file(code) if yor mess up your codes at later stages.

-------------------------------------------------------------
** An os could be devided into two parts
a. Kernel b. shell

a:: Kernel is the interface of the hardware of your operating system.
b:: Shell is the UI between a user and kernel to control your sysem.


There are two types of shell.
a. GUI (Graphical user interface) : Interface based on graphics.
Ex: Windows, Macfinder

b. CLI (command line interface) : Interface based on commands (In text format)
Ex: git BASH (for Linex like systems) , cmd (for windows), powershell etc.

The work flow of git scm

                    $git add                     $ git commit -m <message>
Working directory ------------> staging area -------------------------------> git repo (local repo)
                            (Intermidiate area)
                git push -u <remote_name: origin> <branch-name: main>
git repo -------------------------------------------------------------------> remote repo

♦ Git repo Initializaion 
♦ After Initializaion of git repo "git" tracks the changes btw the working directory and the git repo
-------------------------                 
Step 1: Initializaion of git 
>git init           // creates a .git folder in your project folder to track the changes


Step 2: Adding your files to local git repositories
< git add <fileName> or  > git add . (add all the files)

************ ".gitignore" fiel  ****************
♦ gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
♫ cheatSheet for ".gitignore" file: https://gist.github.com/jstnlvns/ebaa046fae16543cc9efc7f24bcd0e31

** before Adding your file, execute the following command to check status
$ git status                # logs details modified files to be commited 
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

  *********** staging all the changes ***********
  $ git add .         # To add all the changes to the staging area
  
  If the file is not staged and you want to get back to your previous changes
  ► $ git diff <file name>      # logs the change and the its previous version at the last save point
  ♦♦♦ To rollout the modification (changes) to the last save point
  ► $ git checkout <file name>

  > step 3 : commit the changes

  $ git commit -m "message log"
  ♦♦♦ git command to log all the commits ♦♦♦
  $ git log  logs the previous commits

  > Step 4 pushing your local git repo to github
  ♦ If it is first time  
  " $ git add remote <remote_name: origin> <url>"  # steps up the remote repo to be used
**** afterwards ********
  ♦ $ git push -u <remote-name: origin> <branch-name: main(default)>

                                    Git Branching and Merging

Description: While working on a project, we might need to work on a new feature of the project or we might 
be working on a project bug simultaneously and disturbing the main branch of the project. Hence we need here a new 
branch which could carry forward our project in a separate direction until we are ready to mearge it to the main 
branch, which is mostly always production ready. 

Commands: 

♦ To check different branches of the repo
$ git branch
  main
* test-branch      // here asteric marks the current working branch

♦ To create new branch 
$ git branch <branch-name>

♦ To switch between branches 
$ git checkout <desired-branch_name>  

************
Merging of the two branches 

Description: Now to merge the newly developed branch with the main project branch
at first we need to switch to the main branch first and then follow the given commands

♦ command to merge
$ git merge test-branch 

# some text modified in the "another branch" and before merging
